# KM-5 Heat-Meter Control Panel

I wrote this program in 2005. It allows to control KM-5 heat-meter using RS232 interface,
you can also connect it thru RS232-USB converter. I never worked for TBN company,
I just used damaged KM-5 devices to develop software for service company startup 
and performed reverse engeneering.  

this program simulates AP-5 and can control real KM-5 heat-meter.
With this program you can also access internal KM-5 database in order to get reports for 
a period of time

Heat meters of KM-5 are intended for measurements and the accounting of thermal energy, volume and mass
expense, volume, weight and parameters of the heat carrier in the opened, closed and deadlock water
systems of heat supply (further according to OVST, ZVST and TVST), and also in systems
circulating and deadlock hot and cold water supply (further GVS and HVS
respectively).
